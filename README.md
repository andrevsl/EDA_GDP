# EDA_GDP

Hello Guys,

I'm trying to analyse the behaviour of the GDP among different sectors of the Economy for Mexico, New Zealand and Sweden in order to evaluate the participation of each sector affect each other, specially how the others could affect Service GDP. 
But I'm not an Economist and currently some lazy and Malicious hackers from Cesar School in Brazil are blocking, erasing my work because the do not want to pay me for some stolen projects that I have. They do not feel intelligent enough to have their own ideas and to sell themselves. They have corrupted the resutlts and data.
The data were download from (https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/), I would prefer that you get the data by yourself due to those hackers.
I was willing to provide insightful information how the different sectors can improve the overall GDP. 
In the futere I would like to add education and other social indicators.
